# SongsCatalog
It turns out git is the perfect tool to maintain a music catalog!

I just use this repo to back up and maintain my personal catalog of music that I like.
Using this repo, I occasionally write programs to generate playlists from time to time.

Maybe you'll find something in here that you like, maybe not. I'm always open to suggestions.
